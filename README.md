## Intro

This is a breakout board for the USB to UART (serial) chip FT231X from FTDI.

## Example uses

*   For prototyping purpose with that IC - I'm curious about the CBUS pins possibilities.
*   Or for straight use as a 3.3V - 5V tolerant - USB to serial converter, for instance to program some Âµcontrollers (ESP8266 anyone ?).

## I want some !

Shared on those fabrication services - not fully tested yet, quick test seems to indicate they work fine.

* [PCBs.io](https://PCBs.io/share/rwxDz) a little cheaper.
* [OSH Park](https://oshpark.com/shared_projects/f9qFRt6w) purpler.

## Motivation

I needed this breakout board to prototype a project of mine which would involve that FTDI chip.

I could have used the nice [sparkfun breakout](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/11736), but I also wanted to rank up my Kicad skills - this is my first "serious" Kicad project.

## Documentation

Nothing yet.

You can probably use some informations from the great [datasheet from FTDI](http://www.ftdichip.com/Support/Documents/DataSheets/ICs/DS_FT231X.pdf).

This breakout is an implementation of the first sample application from that document.
